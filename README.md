Making a program to test the likely-hood of a winning solitaire deck in a certain kind of solitaire game

The game is deterministic. There is no player choice, so I wanted to find the likelihood of winning on a long term. This was a bit of a rough implementation of the games algorithm (I relied way too much on breaks and continues) but it's working. More than anything though, I wanted to do this to practice using python because all of my recent projects have been built in C++
